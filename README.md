#  Hello, I'm Fatma

 Iâ€™ve officially completed the **ALX Professional Foundation (PF)** program â€” and what an incredible journey it has been!

During this program, I strengthened key professional skills that go far beyond technical knowledge:

- âœ… Critical Thinking  
- âœ… Time Management  
- âœ… Effective Communication   
- âœ… Collaboration  
- âœ… Self-Awareness

 * Now, Iâ€™m beginning the next chapter: Back-End Development with ALX!**  
I'm learning how to build powerful, real-world backend systems â€” and Iâ€™m excited to share my journey here on GitHub.
